The wide world is all about you: you can fence yourselves in,
but you cannot for ever fence it out

Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by
prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests
to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all
understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ
Jesus.

The rules of the Hunger Games are simple. In punishment for
the uprising, each of the twelve districts must provide one
girl and one boy, called tributes, to participate. The
twenty-four tributes will be imprisoned in a vast outdoor
arena that could hold anything from a burning desert to a
frozen wasteland. Over a period of several weeks, the
competitors must fight to the death. The last tribute standing
wins.
